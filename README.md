# ExpressJS Starter

A decent starting point for an ExpressJS application.

## Prerequisites

These steps assume that you are running on an Ubuntu-based OS:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install nodejs npm
$ sudo ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node
```

## Getting Started

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/jekhokie/expressjs-starter.git
$ cd expressjs-starter/
$ npm install
$ DEBUG=expressjs-starter:* npm start -a 0.0.0.0
```

You should now be able to visit the base application at the following URL,
assuming that your IP address is '10.11.13.14':

http://10.11.13.14:3000
